##  :clipboard: Description

This is a test made for a quality engineering position at CloudWalk, a Brazilian fintech. It's my third attempt at working there, and, as wise men say, third time's a charm. Here we go.

Here's the [link to the original challenge](https://gist.github.com/cloudwalk-tests/af5ede5940b6b03902a532264e3d527e).

## :computer:	 Technologies and Concepts

- Read and parse .log files
- Testing with Jest

***

## üèÅ Running the Application

This project was made using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en), so, to run it, you must have the engine properly installed and running on your machine.

To run the application, you must, first of all, clone this repository into your local machine, by running the following command:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:adnanbezerra/cloudwalk-qualityengineer.git
```

Then, you will need to download its dependencies by running

``` bash
npm install
```

Once it's done, you can now run the application with the script

``` bash
npm run parser
```

Or you can run the tests with the command

``` bash
T.B.D.
```
